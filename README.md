# Sistem Manajemen Tangkapan Ikan FCO

Sistem Manajemen Tangkapan Ikan FCO adalah aplikasi berbasis Django REST API yang dirancang untuk membantu pengelolaan laporan tangkapan ikan dari para pemilik kapal. Sistem ini menyediakan cara yang terstruktur dan skalabel untuk mencatat dan mengelola data terkait aktivitas penangkapan ikan, kapal, pemilik, dan spesies.

## Fitur Utama

1. **Pelaporan Tangkapan Ikan**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) untuk laporan tangkapan ikan
2. **Manajemen Kapal**: Pendaftaran dan detail kapal penangkap ikan
3. **Manajemen Pemilik**: Manajemen pemilik kapal (perorangan dan perusahaan)
4. **Katalog Spesies Ikan**: Database spesies ikan yang komprehensif
5. **Manajemen Area Penangkapan**: Pengelolaan area dan lokasi penangkapan
6. **Autentikasi Fleksibel**: Login menggunakan username atau nomor registrasi kapal
7. **Import Data**: Import data spesies ikan, ikan individual, kapal, dan area penangkapan dari file CSV/Excel
8. **Sistem Peran Pengguna**: Manajemen peran untuk admin KKP, pemilik kapal, dan nahkoda
9. **Prediksi Kuota dengan AI**: Prediksi kuota penangkapan ikan menggunakan algoritma LSTM dan NSGA-III
10. **Blockchain untuk Immutabilitas Data**: Pencatatan otomatis laporan tangkapan ikan ke dalam blockchain

## Teknologi yang Digunakan

- **Backend**: Django (v4.2.3)
- **API Framework**: Django REST Framework (v3.14.0)
- **Dokumentasi API**: drf-spectacular (Swagger UI dan Redoc)
- **Database**: SQLite (default untuk pengembangan)
- **Machine Learning**: Implementasi algoritma LSTM dan NSGA-III untuk prediksi kuota
- **Blockchain**: Implementasi sederhana untuk pencatatan immutable data

## Instalasi

1. **Buat virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Instal dependensi**:

   ```bash
   pip install django djangorestframework drf-spectacular numpy pandas xlsxwriter
   ```

3. **Terapkan migrasi database**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Buat pengguna admin**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Jalankan server pengembangan**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Prediksi Kuota dengan AI

Sistem ini menyertakan fitur prediksi kuota penangkapan ikan yang canggih menggunakan dua algoritma:

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Jaringan saraf tiruan yang menganalisis tren historis penangkapan untuk memprediksi kuota masa depan
2. **NSGA-III (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III)**: Algoritma optimasi multi-objektif yang menyeimbangkan produktivitas, keberlanjutan, dan dampak lingkungan

### Fitur Prediksi Kuota:

- Prediksi kuota bulanan berdasarkan data historis penangkapan
- Interval kepercayaan untuk prediksi LSTM
- Skor kebugaran untuk prediksi NSGA-III
- Rekomendasi kuota gabungan berdasarkan kedua algoritma
- Analisis tren dan pola penangkapan

### Cara Menggunakan Prediksi Kuota:

1. Pastikan kapal memiliki data historis penangkapan yang cukup
2. Kirim permintaan POST ke `/api/ships/predict-quota/` dengan nomor registrasi kapal
3. Sistem akan menghasilkan prediksi kuota berdasarkan algoritma yang dipilih
4. Gunakan rekomendasi untuk menentukan kuota penangkapan yang optimal

## Autentikasi

Sistem mendukung autentikasi fleksibel yang memungkinkan nahkoda atau pemilik kapal untuk masuk menggunakan:

1. **Username** - Metode tradisional menggunakan username dan password
2. **Nomor Registrasi Kapal** - Metode alternatif menggunakan nomor registrasi kapal dan password
