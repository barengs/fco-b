# Blockchain Feature Summary

## Overview

The blockchain module automatically records fish catch reports in an immutable ledger. Every time a user submits a fish catch report, the relevant data is automatically added to the blockchain.

## Key Components

### 1. Models

- **BlockchainBlock**: Represents a block in the blockchain
- **FishCatchTransaction**: Represents a fish catch transaction recorded in the blockchain
- **BlockchainConfig**: Configuration settings for the blockchain

### 2. Core Functions

- **calculate_hash()**: Calculates SHA256 hash for blocks
- **mine_block()**: Mines new blocks with proof-of-work
- **create_fish_catch_transaction()**: Creates blockchain transactions for fish catches
- **verify_blockchain()**: Verifies blockchain integrity

### 3. Automation

- Django signals automatically trigger blockchain recording when [CatchDetail](file:///Users/ROFI/Develop/proyek/fco_project/catches/models.py#L23-L36) objects are created
- No manual intervention required for recording

### 4. API Endpoints

- `GET /api/blockchain/status/`: Check blockchain status
- `GET /api/blockchain/transactions/`: View all transactions
- `GET /api/blockchain/blocks/`: View all blocks

### 5. Management Commands

- `init_blockchain`: Initialize blockchain with genesis block
- `verify_blockchain`: Verify blockchain integrity

## Data Recorded

For each fish catch report, the following data is recorded:

- Ship registration number
- Fishing area code
- Fish species code
- Fish name
- Quantity and unit
- Catch date
- Timestamp

## Security Features

- **Immutability**: Data cannot be altered once recorded
- **Hash Chaining**: Each block references the previous block's hash
- **Proof-of-Work**: Simple mining algorithm secures the chain
- **Verification**: Built-in integrity checking

## Implementation Details

This is a simplified blockchain implementation for educational purposes:

- Uses SHA256 hashing
- Simple proof-of-work with hash prefix requirement
- Automatic recording via Django signals
- JSON data storage in blocks

## Future Enhancements

1. Network distribution
2. Advanced consensus algorithms
3. Smart contract functionality
4. Data encryption
5. Performance optimization
